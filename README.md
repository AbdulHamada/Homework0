## Getting familiar with Git &amp; GitHub

Throughout the semester we will be using a software called **git**, a version control system for software development. While its primary use is to organize the source code of a software project which may be developed not by a single programmer but a team, something that is not directly the case for us, it will help us to distribute and collect homework.

The primary workflow is the following. In **git** files such as C++ source code are organized in *respositories*. A repository is a collection of files, for each homework or labclass there will be one *repository*.
